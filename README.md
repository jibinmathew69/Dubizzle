Writing Python and Django code!


The repository contains 2 questions on Python for coding and a question on Django for refactoring.<br />

<b>[Q1]() : </b> Fetch movies details from URL, queried by a substring and return an array of titles in sorted order.<br />
<b>[Q2]() : </b> An array of string is passed and for each string in the array we count the number of operations that needs to be performed so that string wouldn't have pairs.<br />
Eg. `aab` needs `1` substitution, `baaab` needs `1`, and `aabb` needs `2` and bab needs `0`.<br />
<b>[Q3]() : </b> Refactor a given function within a sample django code to production quality.
